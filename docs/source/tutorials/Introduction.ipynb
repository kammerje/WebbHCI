    "# Introduction to spaceKLIP\n",

    "\n",
    "## Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "spaceKLIP supports all stages of reduction of JWST coronagraphic data, from raw ramps to PSF-subtracted images to calibrated photometry and contrast curves. It does this via subclassing and extending the JWST pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular spaceKLIP will help to:\n",
    "1. Perform ramp fitting (pipeline stage 1) with settings optimized for coronagraphic data with NIRCam and MIRI\n",
    "2. Process your images to register references and science data together, clean bad pixels, and so on. \n",
    "3. Perform PSF subtraction using RDI or ADI for diversity, and using the KLIP or NMF algorithms. \n",
    "4. Perform calibrated photometric and astrometric measurements on coronagraphic data. \n",
    "5. Conduct forward modeling to understand systematics, or inject sources to measure achieved contrast levels, and other such supporting calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Organizing your data\n",
    "\n",
    "spaceKLIP expects to work with files organized with particular directory structure, to help organize the outputs of each stage of processing. This includes having multiple output subdirectories for different PSF subtraction runs (e.g. trying different PSF subtraction methods or parameters to optimize subtraction performance.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of typical directory structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Understanding spaceKLIP Config Files\n",
    "\n",
    "SpaceKLIP makes heavy use of configuration files to define inputs and parameters. These are text files using YAML syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "The config files are complicated and have many settings. For now, it's best to start from an existing config file and modify as needed for other datasets. There may eventually be utility functions to automatically generate configuration files, but not yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration settings are <a href='https://spaceklip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Config_file.html'>partially documented here</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configuration files are per each observation mode, including filter + occulter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, it's necessary to have a separate config file per each unique coronagraph dataset (including choice of occulter and filter). For instance, if you have a target observed with NIRCam MASK335R in 3 different filters, you will need 3 different config files, one per filter. \n",

    "#### Specifying Paths in Config Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Config files need to include paths to the data files to reduce. You may do this with full absolute paths or relative path. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help enable portable use of config files shared between users or on different computers, paths can be specified using environment variables, or using `~` to refer to the home directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended, but not required, to define an environment variable `$SPACEKLIP_DATA_PATH` and set this to the directory under which you would like to organize your data. Doing this, plus organizing your data as recommended above, will help to allow sharing config files between users for reproducible science. \n"
